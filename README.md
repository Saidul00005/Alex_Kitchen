## Process to submit a Hotfix for "Alex Kitchen" Project

When you work on a project like "Alex Kitchen" and want to use Git for version control, then you should follow these conventions and steps to submit a hotfix:

### Naming the Hotfix Branch

In order to name the hotfix branch, you should follow a convention that clearly indicates the purpose of the branch. A typical naming convention for hotfix branches is `hotfix/<description>`. For example, if a person wants to fix a critical bug related to a Navigation bar issue, he/she should name that branch `hotfix/navbar-issue`.

### Steps to create a PR and merge the Hotfix Branch with the Production Branch

1. **Create the Hotfix Branch:**
   - First, ensure that you are on the main or production branch.
   - Pull the latest changes to ensure that main branch is up to date.
     ```sh
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```
   - Create a new branch for hotfix.
     ```sh
     git checkout -b hotfix/Navbar-issue
     ```

2. **Implement the Hotfix:**
   - Make the necessary changes to fix the issue.
   - Stage and commit changes with a descriptive message.
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Navbar menu's list-style related issue on different devices got fixed."
     ```

3. **Push the Hotfix Branch to the Remote Repository:**
   - Push hotfix branch to the remote repository.
     ```sh
     git push origin hotfix/payment-issue
     ```

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
   - First, you need to navigate to your repository on GitHub (or preferred Git hosting service).
   - Then, you should see a prompt to create a PR for your recently pushed branch. If not, navigate to the Pull Requests tab and click on "New pull request".
   - After that, select hotfix branch (`hotfix/navbar-issue`) as the source branch and the production branch (commonly `main` or `master`) as the target branch.
   - Provide a descriptive title and detailed description of the hotfix in the PR.
   - Request reviews from other team members if required by your workflow.

5. **Review and Approve the PR:**
   - Wait for team members to review your PR. Address any feedback or requested changes by making additional commits to your hotfix branch.
   - Once approved, you can proceed to merge the PR.

6. **Merge the PR:**
   - Ensure the PR checks (like CI/CD pipelines, automated tests) have passed.
   - Merge the PR into the production branch. This can usually be done by clicking the "Merge pull request" button on the GitHub PR page.
   - Depending on your workflow, you might choose "Squash and merge," "Rebase and merge," or a standard merge. For hotfixes, a standard merge is often appropriate.

7. **Post-Merge Steps:**
   - After merging, ensure to pull the latest changes from the production branch to keep your local repository up to date.
     ```sh
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```
   - Delete the hotfix branch from the remote repository if itâ€™s no longer needed.
     ```sh
     git push origin --delete hotfix/payment-issue
     ```
   - Optionally, delete the local hotfix branch.
     ```sh
     git branch -d hotfix/payment-issue
     ```

By following these steps, you can effectively manage the submission and merging of a hotfix in a project using Git for version control.
